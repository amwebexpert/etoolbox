Comments indicate code that is not self-documenting. The smell is the *need* for the comment — the reader could not work out what the code does from the names and structure alone.

Extract complex logic into well-named functions instead of explaining with a comment. A function called `applyDiscountForLoyalCustomers` does not need a header explaining what it does.

Remove comments unless they impact functionality (executable annotations) or explain *why* something non-obvious was chosen (a workaround for a specific library bug, a reference to a spec). Comments that explain *what* the code does are almost always redundant — or worse, drift out of sync with the code and start lying.

Do not delete an `eslint-disable` or shebang on autopilot — those are flagged separately and exempted from this rule.

**When the comment must stay**: If the code is already as clear as it can be and the comment explains *why* — not *what* — keep it. Put `habit-hooks-disable non-essential-comment` on the same line. That suppresses the finding and signals you've checked: this isn't redundant narration, it's necessary context (workaround, constraint, spec link, etc.).

**AVOID**: using the disable to keep comments that merely restate what the code does. If a better name or extraction removes the need, do that instead.
